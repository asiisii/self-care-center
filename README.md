## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices.
In this solo project for Turing Software & Design School, I built an app that lets user view different mantra and affirmations. If the user wants to favorite it, they can click on the favorite(❤️) and to view their saved messages they can click on `View ❤️` . For better understanding please watch the attached gif.

## Future Additions

I would like to add an option for user to add their own message and play calm background music while they're on this website.
